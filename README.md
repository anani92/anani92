### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Abdulrahman
![I am full-stack developer](anani.website)


I am a self-taught Software Engineer who fell in love with coding! I enjoy learning new technologies. I came from a non-traditional background. I studied law in Egypt. I have experience in business, and Law enforcement. 

My interest in computer science started when I was a kid. after trying so many things in life, nothing could satisfy me and I wanted something that I really enjoy doing, My curiosity led me to read more about programming as I naturally had the intution for the computers and softwares so I knew at somepoint that programming is for me. I started taking online programming courses, and I was fascinated by how coding can teach me to think, to be creative, and to go beyond my imagination. 

After teaching myself to code for a year, I decided to join Coding Dojo bootcamp to gain the opportunity to work on dev teams, collaborate with others, and to help other students, I learned 3 full stacks within 3 months (MERN, JAVA, Python), and some  projects using different technologies. 


Skills: JAVA, Python/Django/Flask, JS/Node JS / REACT / REDUX / HTML / CSS MONGODB/MYSQL/POSTGRESQL
